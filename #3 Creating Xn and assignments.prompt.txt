#3a The CoNexus.Api.Domain.Xn class handles 'external entities' that are sync'd from a CRM that is logged in to CoNexus.  Each has a similar structure, so they share a model. There are six XnTypes: Tenant (the differentiator in the multi-tenant CoNexus app); Event (a large gathering of people); Session (content delivery activities), Evos (EVO = "Event Organizers", local admins that run CoNexus during an Event), Presenters (subject matter experts that deliver content in Sessions), and Attendees.

We will add code to the Files in this project so that we can assign Xns to each other for the following use cases:

1. Tenants and their associated data must be isolated from every other Tenant, and can be deleted when a Tenant fails to renew their license.  In Xns, Tenant records are referenced (FK to int Xn.Id) by every Event, Session, Evo, Presenter, and Attendee associated with them.
1. Assign Sessions to Event: Events can have 0-n Sessions.
2. Assign Evos to Event: Events can have 0-n Evos.
3. Assign Presenters to Sessions: one Session can have many Presenters, and a Presenter can work on many Sessions.
4. Attendees have no such relationships.
