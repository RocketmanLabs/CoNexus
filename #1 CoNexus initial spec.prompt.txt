#1 I need to develop a Windows .NET 9 API Survey app that will be a service to a custom CRM. It will be written in C#.  

An existing CRM will provide user records to the Survey app and maintain them through periodic sync calls. 

The Survey app we are designing needs to support: 1) Survey creation and editing; Collection of responses when the CRM requests it; Response aggregation and reporting + CSV export of results. 

Surveys consist of a Survey record which holds 1-n Questions. Questions can be multiple choice (single answer) or free-form text comments. 

Users syncâ€™d from the CRM will respond to the Questions when the CRM requests a survey to be published. Scheduling is the responsibility of the CRM.  Users respond to the Questions and the Survey app will track which Questions have been answered. 

Results will be presented per user, per Question and per Survey, with the last two calculating N, mean, median, stddev, and mode(s).
